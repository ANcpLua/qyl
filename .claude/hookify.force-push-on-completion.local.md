**Task Completion Reminder**

When you've completed your task:

1. **Force push the code** - You have permission to force push without asking. Just do it.
2. Use `git push --force-with-lease` (safer) or `git push --force` as needed
3. You are authorized to use all tools, superpowers, and plugins whenever needed - no permission required

**Do not ask for permission** - you already have it. Act autonomously and push your changes.
