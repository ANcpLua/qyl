# Hello Command

When this command is invoked with `/hello`, greet the user warmly and explain what this example plugin demonstrates:

1. **Skills** - The example-workflow skill shows how to guide multi-step processes
2. **Commands** - This command itself demonstrates custom slash commands
3. **Hooks** - The plugin includes hooks that trigger on specific events
