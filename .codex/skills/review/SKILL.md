## Security Issues

### HIGH: SQL injection risk

Location: src/api/users.ts:42
Code: const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;
Suggestion: Use parameterized queries.

## Style Issues

### MEDIUM: Function too long

Location: src/services/auth.ts:89
The authenticateUser function is 87 lines.
Suggestion: Extract helper functions.

## Performance Issues

### LOW: N+1 query pattern

Location: src/api/posts.ts:23
Posts are fetched in a loop.
Suggestion: Use eager loading or batch queries.

## Summary

- Critical: 0
- High: 1
- Medium: 1
- Low: 1
- Info: 2

Recommendation: Address high-severity issues before merging.
